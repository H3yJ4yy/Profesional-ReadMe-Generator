  ### Installation
  Starting off in our terminal, the user will have to make sure that they are inside the Profesional ReadMe Generator folder. Once inside the user will need to install Inquirer by typing into their terminal 'node i inquirer@8.2.4' and hitting enter/return. Once the inquirer has been installed, to generate their personal readme, they will enter again in their terminal 'node index.js'.  After entering, the terminal should begin asking the user questions pertaining to sections of their readme to ensure the user is providing the appropriate responses to suit their projects. Once the user has finished submitting their information to the terminal while making sure everything is correct, they will receive a message in their terminal that their readme has been generated and their professional Readme will have been generated in a README.md file with all the information provided 

  ### Usage
 This project should allow users to be able to create a professional ReadMe.md through their terminal without having to worry about the formatting as that will be done for them!
